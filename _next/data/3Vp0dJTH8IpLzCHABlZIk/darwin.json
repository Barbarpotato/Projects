The project involves creating a data pipeline where information from various sources is extracted, preprocessed, and converted into vector embeddings using state-of-the-art models. These embeddings are stored in a specialized vector database, enabling efficient similarity searches. When a user submits a question, the system retrieves relevant data from the database, combines it with a generative model, and produces contextually accurate and insightful answers. This approach enhances the systemâ€™s ability to respond dynamically, leveraging both static knowledge and real-time external data.","htmlImage":"<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/project-content/1741506542533_Darwin-2.webp\" width=\"600px\" height=\"600px\"/><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/project-content/darwin-main.png\" width=\"600px\" height=\"600px\"/><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/project-content/1741506546661_Darwin-3.webp\" width=\"600px\" height=\"600px\"/>","slug":"darwin"}},"__N_SSG":true}
